before midnight Saturday.\", \"Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely follow Gilbert's movement.\", 'An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles west of Santo Domingo.', 'Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.', 'The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.', \"The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the storm.\", 'The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.', \"Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto Rico's south coast.\", 'There were no reports of casualties.', 'San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night.', 'On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.', 'Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain.', 'Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm season, was the second hurricane.', 'The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last month .'], ['Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.', 'There were no immediate reports of casualties.', 'Telephone communications were affected.', \"``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\", \"``We've already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip.\", \"``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,'' Sheets said.\", 'Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.', \"Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.\", 'All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.', \"``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami.\", 'Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and Haiti.', 'Warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic.', \"``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service said, adding, ``Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica''.\", \"The Associated Press' Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches.\", 'Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane.', 'Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians and electricians to report to work.', \"The weather bureau predicted Gilbert's center, 140 miles southeast of Kingston before dawn, would pass south of Kingston and hit the southern parish of Clarendon.\", 'Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of Portland on the northeast and St. Mary on the north.', 'The north coast tourist region from Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was expected only to receive heavy rain.', 'Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground.', \"``It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time,'' said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center.\", 'Forecasters at the center said the eye of Gilbert was 140 miles southeast of Kingston at dawn today.', 'Maximum sustained winds were near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north and 100 miles to the south.', \"Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger''.\", 'Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola.', \"``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the United States,'' said Martin Nelson, another meteorologist at the center.\", \"``It's moving at about 17 mph to the west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass central Cuba''.\", \"Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma.\", 'In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm.', \"Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula, then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti.\", \"The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal

Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic.', 'High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches.', \"Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane.\", 'The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged residents to seek higher ground.', \"Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the island.\", 'In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane.', 'Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared to be passing southeastern Cuba.', \"``They have reported maximum winds of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said Ross.\", \"``But there are no reports of injuries or damage''.\", \"The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to ``Condition Two,'' meaning

facilities, Ross said.', 'Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico.', \"Residents of the neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were urged to ``rush all preparatory actions''.\", \"The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings along the beaches''.\", \"``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,''

the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor injuries.', 'The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.', \"Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.\", \"The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000

Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata said about 11,000 fled.', 'More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast were evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.', 'The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howling winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. EDT.', 'The winds bent and toppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings.', 'Ham radio operators around Cancun said Gilbert knocked down a radio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blew the roofs off buildings.', 'Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone in Cancun and there were no relief efforts under way by late Wednesday.', 'Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets and power was out.', \"``We can't do it yet.\", \"The wind would blow them away,'' said an army official at city hall who declined to give his name.\", 'Bands of 25-30 youths roamed the streets of Cancun Wednesday, looting stores with shattered windows, said Alfredo Moro Sanchez, investigative coordinator of the Quintana Roo state judicial police.', 'He said he asked for army troops to halt the looting but none had arrived by late Wednesday.', 'About 150 tourists took refuge at the Cancun city hall.',

who did not want to leave yesterday,'' the army official said.\", '``It was something new.', \"They didn't know what a cyclone was''.\", 'At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.5 north, longitude 90.2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan, about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said.', 'The storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement.', 'Gilbert was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and winds had decreased to 125 mph.', 'The Mexican National Weather Service reported winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained winds of 179 mph.', 'Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane.', 'Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.', \"By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan Peninsula and gets back in open water''.\", 'As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again.', 'One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25 miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore.', \"``This is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane moved back over the water, and we do expect intensification,'' he said.\", 'Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 people.', 'Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'The peninsula ports of Campeche, Celestum, Progreso, Sinzal, Ucaltepen, Tel-Chac, Cancun, Puerto Morelos, and Ciudad del Carmen were closed, the government news agency Notimex said.', 'Airports in the region were closed.', \"``The sound of the wind outside is horrible,'' said receptionist Pablo Torres at Cancun's Hotel Carrillos as the storm approached.\", 'The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.', 'In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it lost telephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a.m. EDT.', 'Public buildings in Cancun were used as shelters, said Cecila Lavalle, a spokesman for Quintana Roo state government in Chetumal, 155 miles southeast of Cozumel.', 'Jennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative in Cancun, said she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but government figures estimate 40,000 to 65,000 monthly visitors.', 'Hurricane warnings were in effect for the entire Yucatan Peninsula and widespread evacuations were reported.', 'Winds destroyed at least 100 homes in slums of Valladolid, a town of about 45,000 about 100 miles from Cozumel, Alberto Pol, a judicial police officer, said by telephone.', 'The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.', 'It was measured at 26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.', \"``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.\", 'On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gilbert pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.', 'Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 billion in aid.', 'Officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five dead.', 'Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths were reported .'], [\"Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.\", \"``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.\", \"``It doesn't happen very often.\", \"How it develops, we don't know''.\", 'Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.', '``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer.', \"About one of six develop,'' said Clark.\", 'By Sept. 8, the system became a depression.', 'It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.', 'A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.', 'When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm.', 'It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph.', \"Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.\", \"``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said Thursday.\", \"``That's something meteorologists would like to know more about''.\", 'But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins.', 'And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.', \"``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck said.\", \"``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence pattern.\", \"That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.\", 'Eventually, a vortex is created.', '``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.', \"That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those winter storms,'' Bleck said.\", 'Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine.', \"Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,'' he said.\", '``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere.', \"That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere''.\", 'When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados, warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.', \"``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development,'' Clark said.\", \"``If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode.\", \"This is where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast.\", '``It is an exciting thing to watch.', \"If you're on the beach watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said.\", 'The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches Tuesday night.', 'That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys .'], ['Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.', 'The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico.', 'In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled.', 'Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would

paid out of state general operating funds.', 'However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have \"loss of income\" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is

insurance cycle in a couple of ways.', 'For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.', 'Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise.',

Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.\", \"Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.\", \"The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.\", \"His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.\", 'What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth.', 'Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.', \"At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.\", 'Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.', 'Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest.', 'Within another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.', \"Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death, however, published material about the company is curiously scarce.\", \"This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved.\", \"One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers.\", 'Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing.', \"Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.\", 'Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.', \"Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology.\", 'As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life.', 'Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system.', 'This technology helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.', \"But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure.\", 'Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every Friday.', 'They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results.', 'District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads.', 'The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation begin the following week.', \"Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however.\", \"One was Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins.\", \"Another was Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for gigantist America.\", \"Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984.\", 'It did, and he did.', \"The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the economies of small US towns was positive or negative.\", \"If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer.\", 'Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the US.', \"But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in building his own American dream .\"], ['WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.', 'On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.', 'The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40.', 'This was its lowest-ever point against the D-mark.', 'The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time.', 'Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbank tightened, their respective monetary policies.', 'The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar.', 'So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent.', 'Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down.', 'While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling.', 'There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall.', 'The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds to inflationary pressures.', 'The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.', 'The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower.', 'The second explanation carries more weight.', \"Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again.\", 'The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.', 'But investors in stocks were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.', 'Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy, looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.', 'The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it was approaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers.', 'The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and the devastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed, although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.', 'The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.', 'But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.', \"The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.\", 'Since there are an estimated 250,000 people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.', 'The biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by Lennar, Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker of pre-manufactured homes in the US .'], ['SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole

storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100.', 'The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover.', \"Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespread destruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.\", 'Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people.', 'Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early

landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.', \"Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.\", 'In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia.', 'Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans.', 'Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.', 'By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph.', 'Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.', \"The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut.\", \"The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.\", 'More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.', 'In north Miami, damage is minimal.', 'Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded.', 'Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000.', \"US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.\", 'Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.', 'Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.', 'Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.', 'Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn.', 'Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn .'], ['DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.', 'Government officials in

dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour.', 'At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed the Bahamas.', \"Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, which bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already caused Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.\", 'However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to assess the costs accurately.', \"The US industry's Property Claims Service, the official compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the Florida bill.\", 'A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coast from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.', 'Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central Louisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this morning.', 'New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north.', \"Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texas and Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down.\", \"These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.\", 'In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some 10-15 miles south of Miami.', 'The town of Homestead, near the centre of the storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.', \"Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage.\", 'More than 24 hours after the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were still without power.', 'The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck.', 'These are also the leading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, together with American International Group.', 'A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company had roughly 20 per cent of the Florida market.', 'The mutually-owned company has no reinsurance.', 'Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its reserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.', 'According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, other insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are Hartford Insurance, Aetna and Travellers.', 'Travellers said it had flown 50 claims adjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses.', \"About 12 per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida last year, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.\", 'The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn .'], ['US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage.', 'The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century.', 'In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands.', 'Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account.', 'That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989.', 'The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday.', \"Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact.\", \"Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's.\", 'Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far.', \"'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said.\", 'The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.', \"Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.\", 'Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.', 'However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage.', 'Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday.', 'It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution.', \"A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations.\", 'Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph.', 'It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf.', 'A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday.', 'The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power.', 'Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located.', 'Its radar and satellite antennae were blown

Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.', 'However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good.', 'Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became demoralized.', 'In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks.', 'Now, doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days.', 'In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.', 'None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain or heart failure.', 'Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage.', 'Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days.', 'After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.', 'However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868.', 'The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million.', 'In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D.

drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said.', 'But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary

near-normal heart pump function _ 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _ diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent, Moss said.', \"In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.\", 'Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was

does not include those who died of blood-vessel diseases, such as strokes).', 'The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby, aspirin.', 'The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.', 'The blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted blood.', 'Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow.', 'Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping to prevent clot formation in the first place.', 'The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite their proven success.', 'But that is beginning to change.', 'Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital.', \"``We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis,'' says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.\", \"``The most important thing we can do is teach patients in advance about the value of early treatment,'' he says.\", 'While most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks, researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks.', 'Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.', 'Most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.', 'The patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group.', 'After six months, not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group.', 'The researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days.', 'In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.', 'All of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk.', 'Early next

damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.', 'Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.', 'Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.', 'Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.', 'TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.', 'Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.', 'Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims

death from heart disease, researchers said today.', 'The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.', 'In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.', 'This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.', 'The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.', 'The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.', 'During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent.', 'In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent.', 'Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.', \"``It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack,'' Buchwald said.\", \"``It is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy, including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack''.\", 'Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions.', \"The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\", 'Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts.', 'Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question.', \"``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid (cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,'' Buchwald said.\", \"``It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol controversy''.\", 'In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone.', 'At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.', \"The surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent.\", 'The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients

from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now.', 'A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compared with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute.', 'Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots.', 'Heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply.', 'But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems, or for those who have high blood pressure, which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA commentary said.', 'Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding.', 'The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute.', \"Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower.\", 'There were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group.', '\"Physicians, will, for a time, be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information,\" said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E.

based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.', '``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.', \"It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said.\", \"He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,'' presented information that was already widely known among scientists.\", 'Allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps.', \"Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.\", 'It was centered in

engineering point of view from this earthquake,'' he said.\", \"``What will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved''.\", 'Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.', 'In addition, some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the Bay Bridge.', 'In some areas of Southern California, there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring.', 'The highest, the USGS says, is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018 .'], [\"Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.\", 'But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.', 'A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.', \"The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.\", 'The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.', 'The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday.', 'These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least 2,500 people.', 'The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again.', \"Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists believed.\", 'That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.', 'Others disagreed.', 'Faced with conflicting estimates, the Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said represented a consensus on the debate.', 'The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years.', 'It said the southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of generating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.', \"Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles of the fault segment.\", \"``Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one,'' Heaton said.\", \"``There was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake''.\", 'The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.', 'Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast doubt on this assumption.', \"Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.\", \"As bad as Tuesday's quake was, ``it was not a 1906 earthquake,'' Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.\", '``The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming.', \"The question is when,'' Peck said .\"], ['Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to

next 30 years .\", 'The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude

in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018 .', 'The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake .', 'A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much .', 'Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency\\'s Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as \"preshocks\" of the Tuesday\\'s 6.9 temblor.', 'He said \"foreshocks\" would not be the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck .', 'Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely.', 'But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months.', 'A 5.9 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area .', 'After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, within the next few days in the vicinity .', 'But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity.', 'The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.', 'Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area .', 'The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea.', \"It has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded history .\", 'Although Tuesday\\'s quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a \"strong\" shock, not a \"major\" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a \"great\" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be .', \"Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades .\", \"But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake.\", 'Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the power of an earthquake .', 'Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another.', \"But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological Survey's Menlo Park office .\", 'Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter .', 'Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake .', \"The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which

or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas.', 'But when a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case .', 'Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger near the Bay Area.', 'But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose,

satellites.', \"``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane specialist Max Mayfield.\", '``In the Caribbean, we were not so certain the word got out.', \"But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated''.\", \"When a hurricane warning goes into effect, ``It's a $50 million statement,'' said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted.\", \"``If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out there,'' he said.\", \"Before the hurricane warning system was established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives.\", 'But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South Carolina.', \"``I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives are concerned,'' Cline said.\", \"After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last several days.\", 'But, he warned, the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in the Pacific.', \"``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death,'' meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as the storm pounded Charleston, S.C. ``But we've done all we can.''\"], ['Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.', 'But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.', \"Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C. ``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service.\", \"Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.\", \"``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner,'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.\", 'The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.', \"``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.\", \"``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength''.\", 'The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.', 'Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.', \"``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.\", 'In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture.', 'Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.', 'Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane.', 'To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.', 'Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.', 'Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.', \"``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.\", \"Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.\", \"``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,'' Emmanuel said.\", 'Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.', \"``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.''\"], [\"Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path across the Caribbean into

Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here.', \"Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s.\", 'He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.', 'Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.', \"``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' he said.\", \"``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will have stronger hurricanes''.\", \"Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts will be even stronger.\", 'Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest.', \"The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.\", 'It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up, the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler.', 'But he said that is unlikley.', \"``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said.\", \"``And that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''\"], [\"Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.\", \"The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.\", \"``We

$165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.', 'There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage\" as

Alabama in 1979, Parsons said .', 'The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.', 'Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs.', 'For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages.', 'Reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies .', 'Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies .', 'Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm.', 'The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with

catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest.', 'But \"this could be a positive for the industry,\" Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized.', 'Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have \"a significant

allowing her to be sent down by British fire.', \"``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' Ballard said.\", '``It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length.', \"It was clearly flooded, stem to stern''.\", \"``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he added.\", 'It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship

to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.\", 'The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety.', 'But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety.', 'Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987.', 'Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration.', 'Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.', 'First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered.', \"Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line.\", 'Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks.', 'These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise.', 'It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs.', 'Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel.', 'But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster.', 'Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations.', 'The IMO has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners.', 'Third, the IMO should be given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training.', 'Much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.', 'Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily.', 'As things stand, it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force.', 'The

their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum.', 'Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age.', 'Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow.', 'The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents.', 'George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.', 'Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.', 'The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the

under pressure last week surprised the nation.', 'Thatcher formally presents her resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new government .', \"The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.\", \"The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned .\", 'In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory.', 'But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major .', 'Thatcher said she was \"thrilled\" by Major\\'s victory, adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders .', \"Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century .\", 'His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next general election.', \"Before Thatcher's resignation, the polls had been favoring Labor .\", 'Appearing outside his official residence at No.', '11 Downing St., next to the prime minister\\'s, Major declared Tuesday evening, \"We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election\" .', '\"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,\" Major said .', 'He complimented his rivals for a campaign based on \"substance, not personality\" .', \"When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same .\", 'Party leaders, however, waived the third ballot -- which was expected to be unanimous -- and Major was declared party leader .', 'After his appointment by the queen today, he is expected to name his Cabinet in a few days .', 'President Bush, en route to Washington after a visit to Mexico, telephoned Major from aboard Air Force One to congratulate him .', '\"The President said he looked forward to working with Major and to maintaining the special relationship\" with Britain, said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater .', 'In Washington, the State and Defense departments also welcomed the news .', '\"We\\'re very glad that it\\'s all settled, and that it was able to be settled so quickly,\" a State Department official said.', '\"We know John Major and expect to work well with him.', 'We don\\'t expect any change in U.S.-U.K. relations\" .', 'After Major\\'s election, Thatcher declared that she wanted everyone \"to rally behind him\".', 'The prime minister had picked Major from among \"backbenchers\" -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as \"a man of the people\" .', 'With her support, he rose swiftly through the Department of Social Security and then the Treasury .', 'Thatcher will remain a member of the House of Commons, representing the Finchley section of London.', 'She and her husband, Denis, will move out of 10 Downing St. today to their house in the South London community of Dulwich .', 'Thatcher may accept a peerage in the House of Lords as a hereditary countess, friends said, since earldoms (the male equivalent) are the traditional award to former prime ministers.', 'That tradition was not followed by recent Labor prime ministers .', 'Major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a seat in the House of Commons in 1979 .', \"He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the party's choosing .\", \"He is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more sympathetic view toward Britain's role in the European Community and has promised to review the controversial community charge, the so-called poll tax introduced by Thatcher .\", 'Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who likely will face Major in the next national election, immediately labeled him \"more of the same\" in the Thatcher mold .', 'The Labor Party had expected to defeat an unpopular Thatcher in the next election .', 'Jack Cunningham, Labor\\'s campaign coordinator, argued that Major\\'s victory was that of the \"Thatcher candidate\" .', \"Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major's own party, a majority in the House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday .\", 'That in a sense was true .', 'With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent.', 'That vote -- while she was in Paris attending the summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe -- forced her into a runoff with Heseltine and ultimately cost her the party leadership .', \"But in that vote, under the party's complicated rules, she needed a majority plus 15% and she fell four votes short.\", \"In Tuesday's ballot, only a simple majority was needed to win outright .\", 'The prime minister\\'s downfall came after she had run into a stretch of unpopularity -- partly through her authoritarian manner, partly because of inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new \"poll tax\" .', 'She also appeared to take an anti-European attitude toward her 11 partners in the European Community, which caused her long-serving Cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech .', 'That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday .', \"The prime minister's failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to reassess her position.\", 'Her closest advisers reported that her support in the House of Commons was eroding, friends said, so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues .', 'At that point, on Thursday morning, both Major and Hurd, loyal members of her Cabinet, entered the race against Heseltine .', 'Many Tories in Parliament were angry at Heseltine for his role in bringing down Thatcher, who had won three national elections during her 15 years as Conservative Party leader .', 'Her 11 1/2-year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century.', 'Her confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad -- and many enemies, here and in the European Community .', 'During the past few days, Major picked up strength among his colleagues, as opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular Tory after Heseltine nationwide .', 'On Monday, Thatcher let it be known that she personally preferred Major to succeed her .', 'Some commentators feared that Thatcher\\'s revelation of her choice might harm Major -- with her comment Tuesday morning that she would make a \"good back-seat driver\".', 'Labor members called Major \"Mrs. Thatcher\\'s poodle\" .', 'But Major was the clear-cut victor in the balloting, held from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday in a House of Commons committee room .', 'After the results were announced, Heseltine declared that the election had been fought \"without rancor and bitterness\".', 'To \"lay the basis for unity,\" he said, he would ask his supporters to vote for Major in the expected third ballot on Thursday, as he himself would do .', 'Soon afterward, Hurd did the same .', 'A third ballot seemed certain until Cranley Onslow, who heads the Conservative Party organization called the 1922 Committee, which supervised the party election, announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared Major the party leader .', \"It was not immediately clear whether Hurd and Heseltine would join Major's Cabinet, though Major's aides indicated they would be offered roles in the government .\", 'Conservative Party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion, with no blood on the floor .', 'The Labor Party, almost overnight, went from being the strong favorite in the next election to second place behind a Tory party led by Major.', 'Recent opinion polls had suggested that any new leader would greatly enhance Tory popularity .', 'Labor\\'s Cunningham declared that the Conservatives\\' lead was \"a temporary blip\" and promised \"to fight an election as soon as he (Major) names a date\" .', 'TORY ELECTION RESULTS Despite being two votes short of a majority, John Major was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers conceded defeat.', 'He will bwcome prime minister when formally confirmed by the Queen .', 'John Major: 185 Michael Heseltine: 131 Douglas Hurd: 56 187 votes needed to win The Conservative Party holds 372 seats in the 650-seat Parliament'], ['         British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be \"forcibly removed\" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully .', 'Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis .', '\"A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won\\'t do,\" Major said in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf .', \"On the gulf issue at least, Major's remarks augured well for his talks with President Bush late in the day at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay .\", 'Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40-hour visit, wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn .', '\"If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp, a country that he\\'s dismantling day after day, then he will have to be forcibly removed,\" Major said.', '\"I hope it won\\'t come to that -- everyone hopes it won\\'t come to that -- but it could\" .', 'At the same time, Major demonstrated the kinder, gentler face he has brought to British politics since his accession, showing none of the abrasiveness that was a Thatcher hallmark.', 'In contrast to Thatcher, he was polite to reporters questioning him .', 'Comparing Major and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, \"The biggest change is personal style\" .', 'Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: \"There is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about\".', 'Hussein, he said, \"has to go\" .']]\n"
