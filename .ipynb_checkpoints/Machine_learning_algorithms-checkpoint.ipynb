In the simplest, sensors stream data or events', 'to a server for lonerm archival storage , where the server ', 'often indexes the data to permit efficient access at a later time. Since', 'sensors may be several hops from the nearest base station, network', 'costs are incurred; however, once data is indexed and archived, ', 'subsequent data accesses can be handled locally at the server without', 'incurring network overhead. In this approach, the storage is ', 'centralized, reads are efficient and cheap, while writes are expensive', 'Further, all data is propagated to the server, regardless of whether', 'it is ever used by the application', 'An alternate approach is to have each sensor store data or events', 'locally (e.g., in flash memory), so that all writes are local and incur', 'no communication overheads. A read request, such as whether an', 'event was detected by a particular sensor, requires a message to', 'be sent to the sensor for processing. More complex read requests', 'are handled by flooding. For instance, determining if an intruder', 'was detected over a particular time interval requires the request to', 'be flooded to all sensors in the system. Thus, in this approach,', 'the storage is distributed, writes are local and inexpensive, while', 'reads incur significant network overheads. Requests that require', 'flooding, due to the lack of an index, are expensive and may waste', 'precious sensor resources, even if no matching data is stored at', 'those sensors. Research efforts such as Directed Diffusion ', 'have attempted to reduce these read costs, however, by intelligent', 'message routing', 'Between these two extremes lie a number of other sensor storage', 'systems with different tradffs, summarized in e 1. The ', 'geographic hash e (GHT) approach  advocates the use of', 'an ietwork index to augment the fully distributed nature of ', 'sensor storage.

There are several distributed index and', 'lookup methods which might be used in this system; however, the', 'index structure described in Section 3 is highly suited for the task', 'Since the index is constructed using a coarsrain summary,', 'instead of the actual data, index lookups will yield approximate', 'matches.

Data Storage and Summarization', 'Having described the proxevel index structure, we turn to the', 'mechanisms at the sensor tier. TSAR implements two key ', 'mechanisms at the sensor tier. The first is a local archival store at each', 'sensor node that is optimized for resourconstrained devices. The', 'second is an adaptive summarization technique that enables each', 'sensor to adapt to changing data and query characteristics. The rest', 'of this section describes these mechanisms in detail', '4.1 Local Storage at Sensors', 'Interval skip graphs provide an efficient mechanism to lookup', 'sensor nodes containing data relevant to a query. These queries are', 'then routed to the sensors, which locate the relevant data records', 'in the local archive and respond back to the proxy. To enable such', 'lookups, each sensor node in TSAR maintains an archival store of', 'sensor data. While the implementation of such an archival store', 'is straightforward on resourcich devices that can run a dase,', 'sensors are often power and resourconstrained. Consequently,', 'the sensor archiving subsystem in TSAR is explicitly designed to', 'exploit characteristics of sensor data in a resourconstrained ', 'setting', 'Timestamp', 'Calibration', 'Parameters', 'Opaque DataDatvent Attributes size', 'reingle storage record', 'Sensor data has very distinct characteristics that inform our ', 'design of the TSAR archival store. Sensors produce timeries data', 'streams, and therefore, temporal ordering of data is a natural and', 'simple way of storing archived sensor data. In addition to ', 'simplicity, a temporally ordered store is often suie for many sensor data', 'processing tasks since they involve timeries data processing. ', 'Examples include signal processing operations such as FFT, wavelet', 'transforms, clustering, similarity matching, and target detection', 'Consequently, the local archival store is a collection of records,', 'designed as an appennly circular buffer, where new records are', 'appended to the tail of the buffer.

TSAR Implementation', 'We have implemented a prototype of TSAR on a multier ', 'sensor network testbed. Our prototype employs Crossbow Stargate', 'nodes to implement the proxy tier.

Usually, in such games, the players are', 'part of the game and in addition they may control entities that make', 'up the game. During the course of the game, the players and the', 'entities move within the game space. A player sends information', 'about her movement as well as the movement of the entities she', 'controls to the other players using a Deaeckoning (DR) vector', 'A DR vector contains information about the current position of the', 'playentity in terms of x, y and z coordinates (at the time the DR', 'vector was sent) as well as the trajectory of the entity in terms of', 'the velocity component in each of the dimensions. Each of the ', 'participating players receives such DR vectors from one another and', 'renders the other playerntities on the local consoles until a new', 'DR vector is received for that playentity. In a peeeer game,', 'players send DR vectors directly to each other; in a clienerver', 'game, these DR vectors may be forwarded through a game server', 'The idea of DR is used because it is almost impossible for ', 'playerntities to exchange their current positions at every time unit', 'DR vectors are quantization of the real trajectory (which we refer', 'to as real path) at a player. Normally, a new DR vector is computed', 'and sent whenever the real path deviates from the path extrapolated', 'using the previous DR vector (say, in terms of distance in the x, y,', 'z plane) by some amount specified by a threshold. We refer to the', 'trajectory that can be computed using the sequence of DR vectors', 'as the exported path. Therefore, at the sending player, there is a ', 'deviation between the real path and the exported path. The error due', 'to this deviation can be removed if each movement of playentity', 'is communicated to the other players at every time unit; that is a', 'DR vector is generated at every time unit thereby making the real', 'and exported paths the same. Given that it is not feasible to ', 'satisfy this due to bandwidth limitations, this error is not of practical', 'interest. Therefore, the receiving players can, at best, follow the', 'exported path. Because of the network delay between the sending', 'and receiving players, when a DR vector is received and rendered', 'at a player, the original trajectory of the playentity may have ', 'already changed. Thus, in physical time, there is a deviation at the', 'receiving player between the exported path and the rendered ', 'trajectory (which we refer to as placed path). We refer to this error', 'as the export error.

Due to the difference in the export errors among the ', 'receivers, the same entity is rendered at different physical time at', 'different receivers. This brings in unfairness in game playing. For', 'instance a player with a large delay would always see an entity', 'late in physical time compared to the other players and, ', 'therefore, her action on the entity would be delayed (in physical time)', 'even if she reacted instantaneously after the entity was rendered', 'Our goal in this paper is to improve the fairness of these games in', 'spite of the varying network delays by equalizing the export error', 'at the players. We explore whether the timverage of the export', 'errors (which is the cumulative export error over a period of time', 'averaged over the time period) at all the players can be made the', 'same by scheduling the sending of the DR vectors appropriately at', 'the sender. We propose two algorithms to achieve this', 'Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the', 'sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to', 'try and make the export error the same at all the players. At an', 'abstract level, the algorithm delays sending DR vectors to players', 'whose accumulated error so far in the game is smaller than others;', 'this would mean that the export error due to this DR vector at these', 'players will be larger than that of the other players, thereby making', 'them the same. The goal is to make this error at least approximately', 'equal at every DR vector with the deviation in the error becoming', 'smaller as time progresses', 'The first algorithm (which we refer to as the scheduling ', 'algorithm) is based on estimating the delay between players and ', 'refining the sending of DR vectors by scheduling them to be sent', 'to different players at different times at every DR generation point', 'Through an implementation of this algorithm using the open source', 'game BZflag, we show that this algorithm makes the game very fair', '(we measure fairness in terms of the standard deviation of the ', 'error). The drawback of this algorithm is that it tends to push the', 'error of all the players towards that of the player with the worst', 'error (which is the error at the farthest player, in terms of delay,', 'from the sender of the DR). To alleviate this effect, we propose', 'a budget based algorithm which budgets how the DRs are sent to', 'different players. At a high level, the algorithm is based on the', 'idea of sending more DRs to players who are farther away from', 'the sender compared to those who are closer. Experimental results', 'from BZflag illustrates that the budget based algorithm follows a', 'more balanced approach. It improves the fairness of the game but', 'at the same time does so without pushing up the mean error of the', 'players thereby maintaining the accuracy of the game. In addition,', 'the budget based algorithm is shown to achieve the same level of', 'accuracy of game playing as the current implementation of BZflag', 'using much less number of DR vectors', '2. PREVIOUS WORK', 'Earlier work on network games to deal with network latency has', 'mostly focussed on compensation techniques for packet delay and', 'loss . These methods are aimed at making large delays and', 'message loss tolerable for players but does not consider the ', 'problems that may be introduced by varying delays from the server to', 'different players or from the players to one another. For example,', 'the concept of local lag has been used in  where each player', 'delays every local operation for a certain amount of time so that ', 'remote players can receive information about the local operation and', 'execute the same operation at the about same time, thus reducing', 'state inconsistencies. The online multlayer game MiMaze [2, 5,', '6], for example, takes a static bucket synchronization approach to', 'compensate for variable network delays. In MiMaze, each player', 'delays all events by 100 ms regardless of whether they are ', 'generated locally or remotely. Players with a network delay larger', 'than 100 ms simply cannot participate in the game. In general,', 'techniques based on bucket synchronization depend on imposing a', 'worst case delay on all the players', 'There have been a few papers which have studied the problem of', 'fairness in a distributed game by more sophisticated message ', 'delivery mechanisms. But these works  assume the existence of', 'a global view of the game where a game server maintains a view', '(or state) of the game. Players can introduce objects into the game', 'or delete objects that are already part of the game (for example, in', 'a firserson shooter game, by shooting down the object). These', 'additions and deletions are communicated to the game server ', 'using action messages. Based on these action messages, the state', 'of the game is changed at the game server and these changes are', 'communicated to the players using update messages. Fairness is', 'achieved by ordering the delivery of action and update messages at', 'the game server and players respectively based on the notion of a', 'fairder which takes into account the delays between the game', 'server and the different players. Objects that are part of the game', 'may move but how this information is communicated to the players', 'seems to be beyond the scope of these works. In this sense, these', 'works are very limited in scope and may be applicable only to ', 'firstperson shooter games and that too to only games where players are', 'not part of the game', 'DR vectors can be exchanged directly among the players ', '(peerteer model) or using a central server as a relay (clienerver', 'model). It has been shown in  that multlayer games that', 'use DR vectors together with bucket synchronization are not ', 'cheatproof unless additional mechanisms are put in place. Both the', 'scheduling algorithm and the budgeased algorithm described in', 'our paper use DR vectors and hence are not chearoof. For ', 'example, a receiver could skew the delay estimate at the sender to', 'make the sender believe that the delay between the sender and the', 'receiver is high thereby gaining undue advantage. We emphasize', 'that the focus of this paper is on fairness without addressing the', 'issue of cheating', 'In the next section, we describe the game model that we use', 'and illustrate how senders and receivers exchange DR vectors and', 'how entities are rendered at the receivers based on the timtamp', 'augmented DR vector exchange as described in . In Section 4,', 'we describe the DR vector scheduling algorithm that aims to make', 'the export error equal across the players with varying delays from', 'the sender of a DR vector, followed by experimental results ', 'obtained from instrumentation of the scheduling algorithm on the', 'open source game BZFlag.

As mentioned before, we assume ', 'synchronized clocks among the participating players', 'Each DR vector sent from one player to another specifies the ', 'trajectory of exactly one playentity.

Thus, the DR vectors sent by a player specifies', 'the current time at the player when the DR vector is computed (not', 'the time at which this DR vector is sent to the other players as we', 'will explain later), the current position of the playentity in terms', 'of the x, y, z coordinates and the velocity vector in the direction', 'of x, y and z coordinates. Specifically, the ith', 'DR vector sent by', 'player j about the kth', 'entity is denoted by DRj', 'ik and is represented', 'by the following tuple (Tj', 'ik, xj', 'ik, yj', 'ik, zj', 'ik, vxj', 'ik, vyj', 'ik, vzj', 'ik)', 'Without loss of generality, in the rest of the discussion, we ', 'consider a sequence of DR vectors sent by only one player and for', 'only one entity. For simplicity, we consider a two dimensional', 'game space rather than a three dimensional one. Hence we use', 'DRi to denote the ith', 'such DR vector represented as the tuple', '(Ti, xi, yi, vxi, vyi). The receiving player computes the starting', 'position for the entity based on xi, yi and the time difference ', 'between when the DR vector is received and the time Ti at which it', 'was computed. Note that the computation of time difference is ', 'feasible since all the clocks are synchronized.

When this DR vector is received, assume that the', 'entity is at point D. A new position for the entity is computed as', '(xx1 × dt1, yy0 × dt1) and the entity is moved to this', 'position (point C). The velocity components vx1 and vy1 are used', 'to project and render this entity further', 'Let us now consider the error due to network delay. Although', 'DR1 was computed at time T1 and sent to the receiver, it did not', 'reach the receiver until time Tt1. This means, although the', 'exported path based on DR1 at the sender at time T1 is the ', 'trajectory AC, until time Tt1, at the receiver, this entity was being', 'rendered at trajectory BD based on DR0. Only at time Tt1', 'did the entity get moved to point C from which point onwards the', 'exported and the placed paths are the same. The deviation between', 'the exported and placed paths creates an error component which we', 'refer to as the export error. A way to represent the export error is', 'to compute the integral of the distance between the two trajectories', 'over the time when they are out of sync. We represent the integral', 'of the distances between the placed and exported paths due to some', 'DR DRi over a time interval [t1, t2] as Err(DRi, t1, t2).

Note that there would have been an export error created due', 'to the reception of DR0 at which time the placed path would have', 'been based on a previous DR vector. This is not shown in the re', 'but it serves to remind the reader that the export error is cumulative', 'when a sequence of DR vectors are received. Starting from time', 'T1 onwards, there is a deviation between the real and the exported', 'paths. As we discussed earlier, this export error is unavoidable', 'The above re and example illustrates one receiver only.

The goal of the DR vector scheduling', 'algorithm to be described in the next section is to make this ', '(cumulative) export error equal at every player independently for each of', 'the entities that make up the game', '4. SCHEDULING ALGORITHM ', 'FORSENDING DR VECTORS', 'In Section 3 we showed how delay from the sender of a new DR', '2', 'Normally, DR vectors are not computed on a periodic basis but', 'on an oemand basis where the decision to compute a new DR', 'vector is based on some threshold being exceeded on the deviation', 'between the real path and the path exported by the previous DR', 'vector', '3', 'vector to the receiver of the DR vector could lead to export error', 'because of the deviation of the placed path from the exported path', 'at the receiver until this new DR vector is received. We also ', 'mentioned that the goal of the DR vector scheduling algorithm is to', 'make the export error equal at all receivers over a period of time', 'Since the game is played in a distributed environment, it makes', 'sense for the sender of an entity to keep track of all the errors at the', 'receivers and try to make them equal.

Each of the ', 'participating players receives such DR vectors from one another and', 'renders the other playerntities on the local consoles until a new', 'DR vector is received for that playentity. In a peeeer game,', 'players send DR vectors directly to each other; in a clienerver', 'game, these DR vectors may be forwarded through a game server', 'The idea of DR is used because it is almost impossible for ', 'playerntities to exchange their current positions at every time unit', 'DR vectors are quantization of the real trajectory (which we refer', 'to as real path) at a player. Normally, a new DR vector is computed', 'and sent whenever the real path deviates from the path extrapolated', 'using the previous DR vector (say, in terms of distance in the x, y,', 'z plane) by some amount specified by a threshold. We refer to the', 'trajectory that can be computed using the sequence of DR vectors', 'as the exported path. Therefore, at the sending player, there is a ', 'deviation between the real path and the exported path. The error due', 'to this deviation can be removed if each movement of playentity', 'is communicated to the other players at every time unit; that is a', 'DR vector is generated at every time unit thereby making the real', 'and exported paths the same. Given that it is not feasible to ', 'satisfy this due to bandwidth limitations, this error is not of practical', 'interest. Therefore, the receiving players can, at best, follow the', 'exported path. Because of the network delay between the sending', 'and receiving players, when a DR vector is received and rendered', 'at a player, the original trajectory of the playentity may have ', 'already changed. Thus, in physical time, there is a deviation at the', 'receiving player between the exported path and the rendered ', 'trajectory (which we refer to as placed path). We refer to this error', 'as the export error. Note that the export error, in turn, results in a', 'deviation between the real and the placed paths', 'The export error manifests itself due to the deviation between the', 'exported path at the sender and the placed path at the receiver (i)', '1', 'before the DR vector is received at the receiver (referred to as the', 'before export error, and (ii) after the DR vector is received at the ', 'receiver (referred to as the after export error). In an earlier paper ,', 'we showed that by synchronizing the clocks at all the players and', 'by using a technique based on timtamping messages that carry', 'the DR vectors, we can guarantee that the after export error is made', 'zero. That is, the placed and the exported paths match after the DR', 'vector is received. We also showed that the before export error can', 'never be eliminated since there is always a noero network delay,', 'but can be significantly reduced using our technique . ', 'Henceforth we assume that the players use such a technique which results', 'in unavoidable but small overall export error', 'In this paper we consider the problem of different and varying', 'network delays between each sendeeceiver pair of a DR vector,', 'and consequently, the different and varying export errors at the ', 'receivers. Due to the difference in the export errors among the ', 'receivers, the same entity is rendered at different physical time at', 'different receivers. This brings in unfairness in game playing. For', 'instance a player with a large delay would always see an entity', 'late in physical time compared to the other players and, ', 'therefore, her action on the entity would be delayed (in physical time)', 'even if she reacted instantaneously after the entity was rendered', 'Our goal in this paper is to improve the fairness of these games in', 'spite of the varying network delays by equalizing the export error', 'at the players. We explore whether the timverage of the export', 'errors (which is the cumulative export error over a period of time', 'averaged over the time period) at all the players can be made the', 'same by scheduling the sending of the DR vectors appropriately at', 'the sender. We propose two algorithms to achieve this', 'Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the', 'sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to', 'try and make the export error the same at all the players. At an', 'abstract level, the algorithm delays sending DR vectors to players', 'whose accumulated error so far in the game is smaller than others;', 'this would mean that the export error due to this DR vector at these', 'players will be larger than that of the other players, thereby making', 'them the same. The goal is to make this error at least approximately', 'equal at every DR vector with the deviation in the error becoming', 'smaller as time progresses', 'The first algorithm (which we refer to as the scheduling ', 'algorithm) is based on estimating the delay between players and ', 'refining the sending of DR vectors by scheduling them to be sent', 'to different players at different times at every DR generation point', 'Through an implementation of this algorithm using the open source', 'game BZflag, we show that this algorithm makes the game very fair', '(we measure fairness in terms of the standard deviation of the ', 'error). The drawback of this algorithm is that it tends to push the', 'error of all the players towards that of the player with the worst', 'error (which is the error at the farthest player, in terms of delay,', 'from the sender of the DR). To alleviate this effect, we propose', 'a budget based algorithm which budgets how the DRs are sent to', 'different players. At a high level, the algorithm is based on the', 'idea of sending more DRs to players who are farther away from', 'the sender compared to those who are closer. Experimental results', 'from BZflag illustrates that the budget based algorithm follows a', 'more balanced approach. It improves the fairness of the game but', 'at the same time does so without pushing up the mean error of the', 'players thereby maintaining the accuracy of the game. In addition,', 'the budget based algorithm is shown to achieve the same level of', 'accuracy of game playing as the current implementation of BZflag', 'using much less number of DR vectors', '2. PREVIOUS WORK', 'Earlier work on network games to deal with network latency has', 'mostly focussed on compensation techniques for packet delay and', 'loss . These methods are aimed at making large delays and', 'message loss tolerable for players but does not consider the ', 'problems that may be introduced by varying delays from the server to', 'different players or from the players to one another. For example,', 'the concept of local lag has been used in  where each player', 'delays every local operation for a certain amount of time so that ', 'remote players can receive information about the local operation and', 'execute the same operation at the about same time, thus reducing', 'state inconsistencies. The online multlayer game MiMaze [2, 5,', '6], for example, takes a static bucket synchronization approach to', 'compensate for variable network delays. In MiMaze, each player', 'delays all events by 100 ms regardless of whether they are ', 'generated locally or remotely. Players with a network delay larger', 'than 100 ms simply cannot participate in the game. In general,', 'techniques based on bucket synchronization depend on imposing a', 'worst case delay on all the players', 'There have been a few papers which have studied the problem of', 'fairness in a distributed game by more sophisticated message ', 'delivery mechanisms. But these works  assume the existence of', 'a global view of the game where a game server maintains a view', '(or state) of the game. Players can introduce objects into the game', 'or delete objects that are already part of the game (for example, in', 'a firserson shooter game, by shooting down the object). These', 'additions and deletions are communicated to the game server ', 'using action messages. Based on these action messages, the state', 'of the game is changed at the game server and these changes are', 'communicated to the players using update messages. Fairness is', 'achieved by ordering the delivery of action and update messages at', 'the game server and players respectively based on the notion of a', 'fairder which takes into account the delays between the game', 'server and the different players. Objects that are part of the game', 'may move but how this information is communicated to the players', 'seems to be beyond the scope of these works. In this sense, these', 'works are very limited in scope and may be applicable only to ', 'firstperson shooter games and that too to only games where players are', 'not part of the game', 'DR vectors can be exchanged directly among the players ', '(peerteer model) or using a central server as a relay (clienerver', 'model). It has been shown in  that multlayer games that', 'use DR vectors together with bucket synchronization are not ', 'cheatproof unless additional mechanisms are put in place. Both the', 'scheduling algorithm and the budgeased algorithm described in', 'our paper use DR vectors and hence are not chearoof. For ', 'example, a receiver could skew the delay estimate at the sender to', 'make the sender believe that the delay between the sender and the', 'receiver is high thereby gaining undue advantage. We emphasize', 'that the focus of this paper is on fairness without addressing the', 'issue of cheating', 'In the next section, we describe the game model that we use', 'and illustrate how senders and receivers exchange DR vectors and', 'how entities are rendered at the receivers based on the timtamp', 'augmented DR vector exchange as described in . In Section 4,', 'we describe the DR vector scheduling algorithm that aims to make', 'the export error equal across the players with varying delays from', 'the sender of a DR vector, followed by experimental results ', 'obtained from instrumentation of the scheduling algorithm on the', 'open source game BZFlag. Section 5, describes the budget based', 'algorithm that achieves improved fairness but without reducing the', 'level accuracy of game playing. Conclusions are presented in ', 'Section 6', '2', '3. GAME MODEL', 'The game architecture is based on players distributed across the', 'Internet and exchanging DR vectors to each other. The DR ', 'vectors could either be sent directly from one player to another ', '(peerteer model) or could be sent through a game server which ', 'receives the DR vector from a player and forwards it to other players', '(clienerver model). As mentioned before, we assume ', 'synchronized clocks among the participating players', 'Each DR vector sent from one player to another specifies the ', 'trajectory of exactly one playentity. We assume a linear DR vector', 'in that the information contained in the DR vector is only enough at', 'the receiving player to compute the trajectory and render the entity', 'in a straight line path. Such a DR vector contains information about', 'the starting position and velocity of the playentity where the ', 'velocity is constant1', '. Thus, the DR vectors sent by a player specifies', 'the current time at the player when the DR vector is computed (not', 'the time at which this DR vector is sent to the other players as we', 'will explain later), the current position of the playentity in terms', 'of the x, y, z coordinates and the velocity vector in the direction', 'of x, y and z coordinates. Specifically, the ith', 'DR vector sent by', 'player j about the kth', 'entity is denoted by DRj', 'ik and is represented', 'by the following tuple (Tj', 'ik, xj', 'ik, yj', 'ik, zj', 'ik, vxj', 'ik, vyj', 'ik, vzj', 'ik)', 'Without loss of generality, in the rest of the discussion, we ', 'consider a sequence of DR vectors sent by only one player and for', 'only one entity. For simplicity, we consider a two dimensional', 'game space rather than a three dimensional one. Hence we use', 'DRi to denote the ith', 'such DR vector represented as the tuple', '(Ti, xi, yi, vxi, vyi). The receiving player computes the starting', 'position for the entity based on xi, yi and the time difference ', 'between when the DR vector is received and the time Ti at which it', 'was computed. Note that the computation of time difference is ', 'feasible since all the clocks are synchronized. The receiving player', 'then uses the velocity components to project and render the ', 'trajectory of the entity.

The', 're shows the reception of DR vectors at a player (henceforth', 'called the receiver). The horizontal axis shows the time which is', 'synchronized among all the players.

When this DR vector is received, assume that the', 'entity is at point D. A new position for the entity is computed as', '(xx1 × dt1, yy0 × dt1) and the entity is moved to this', 'position (point C). The velocity components vx1 and vy1 are used', 'to project and render this entity further', 'Let us now consider the error due to network delay. Although', 'DR1 was computed at time T1 and sent to the receiver, it did not', 'reach the receiver until time Tt1.

Only at time Tt1', 'did the entity get moved to point C from which point onwards the', 'exported and the placed paths are the same. The deviation between', 'the exported and placed paths creates an error component which we', 'refer to as the export error. A way to represent the export error is', 'to compute the integral of the distance between the two trajectories', 'over the time when they are out of sync. We represent the integral', 'of the distances between the placed and exported paths due to some', 'DR DRi over a time interval [t1, t2] as Err(DRi, t1, t2). In the', 're, the export error due to DR1 is computed as the integral of', 'the distance between the trajectories AC and BD over the time', 'interval [T1, Tt1]. Note that there could be other ways of ', 'representing this error as well, but in this paper, we use the integral of', 'the distance between the two trajectories as a measure of the export', 'error. Note that there would have been an export error created due', 'to the reception of DR0 at which time the placed path would have', 'been based on a previous DR vector. This is not shown in the re', 'but it serves to remind the reader that the export error is cumulative', 'when a sequence of DR vectors are received. Starting from time', 'T1 onwards, there is a deviation between the real and the exported', 'paths. As we discussed earlier, this export error is unavoidable', 'The above re and example illustrates one receiver only. But', 'in reality, DR vectors DR0 and DR1 are sent by the sender to all', 'the participating players. Each of these players receives DR0 and', 'DR1 after varying delays thereby creating different export error', 'values at different players.

The scheduling approach and', 'the base case where each DR vector was sent to all the receivers', 'concurrently at every trigger point were implemented in the same', 'run by tagging the DR vectors according to the type of approach', 'used to send the DR vector. NISTNet  was used to introduce', 'delays across the sender and the three receivers. Mean delays of', '800ms, 500ms and 200ms were introduced between the sender and', 'first, second and the third receiver, respectively. We introduce a', 'variance of 100 msec (to the mean delay of each receiver) to model', 'variability in delay.

This shows that the scheduling approach achieves', 'fairness among the receivers even if they are at different distances', '(i.e, latencies) from the sender', 'Observe that the mean of the accumulated error increased ', 'multifold with scheduling in comparison to the base case. Further ', 'exploration for the reason for the rise in the mean led to the conclusion', 'that every time the DR vectors are scheduled in a way to equalize', 'the total error, it pushes each receivers total error higher. Also, as', 'the accumulated error has an estimated component, the schedule is', 'not accurate to equalize the errors for the receivers, leading to the', 'DR vector reaching earlier or later than the actual schedule. In ', 'either case, the error is not equalized and if the DR vector reaches', 'late, it actually increases the error for a receiver beyond the highest', 'accumulated error. This means that at the next trigger, this receiver', 'will be the one with highest error and every other receiver\"s error', 'will be pushed to this error value. This flilop effect leads to', 'the increase in the accumulated error for all the receivers', 'The scheduling for fairness leads to the decrease in standard ', 'deviation (i.e., increases the fairness among different players), but it', 'comes at the cost of higher mean error, which may not be a ', 'desirable feature.

INCONSISTENCY IN DR', 'The inconsistency in DR can be divided into two sections by the', 'time point when a remote site receives a state update.

By employing', 'physical clock synchronization, GR can accurately calculate', 'the states of shared entities after receiving state updates, and it', 'can eliminate after inconsistency.

The first reason is the delay of sending state', 'updates, as local site does not send a state update unless the', 'difference between accurate state and the estimated one is larger', 'than a predefined threshold. The second reason is network', 'transmission delay, as a shared entity can be synchronized only', 'after remote sites receiving corresponding state update', 're 1.

At the beginning, the positions of the shared', 'entity are the same at sites i and j and the velocity of the shared', 'entity is 0. Before time point t0, the paths of the shared entity at', 'sites i and j in x coordinate are exactly the same. At time point t0,', 'the player at site i issues an operation, which changes the velocity', 'in x axis to v0.

At', 'time point t2, the state update reaches site j, and the received state', 'and the time deviation between time points t1 and t2 are used to', 'calculate the current position of the shared entity.

Thus if network transmission', 'delay is less than the specific value of a game system, n can be set', 'to the specific value.

In the case that a', 'large n must be used, some HCI methods (e.g. echo ) can be', 'used to relieve the negative effects of the large lag. In the case', 'that n is larger than the network transmission delay, GL', 'can eliminate most before inconsistency. Traditional local lag', 'requests that the lag value must be larger than typical network', 'transmission delay, otherwise state repairs would flood the system', 'However GL allows n to be smaller than typical network', 'transmission delay.

In the other category, the', 'network transmission delay was fixed at 800 ms and three', 'different lags (100 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms) were used. Therefore', 'the total number of settings used in the evaluation was 12 (2 × 6)', 'The procedure of performance evaluation was composed of three', 'steps. In the first step, two participants were employed to play the', 'game, and the operation sequences were recorded.

INCONSISTENCY IN DR', 'The inconsistency in DR can be divided into two sections by the', 'time point when a remote site receives a state update.

By employing', 'physical clock synchronization, GR can accurately calculate', 'the states of shared entities after receiving state updates, and it', 'can eliminate after inconsistency.

The first reason is the delay of sending state', 'updates, as local site does not send a state update unless the', 'difference between accurate state and the estimated one is larger', 'than a predefined threshold. The second reason is network', 'transmission delay, as a shared entity can be synchronized only', 'after remote sites receiving corresponding state update', 're 1.

At the beginning, the positions of the shared', 'entity are the same at sites i and j and the velocity of the shared', 'entity is 0. Before time point t0, the paths of the shared entity at', 'sites i and j in x coordinate are exactly the same. At time point t0,', 'the player at site i issues an operation, which changes the velocity', 'in x axis to v0.

At', 'time point t2, the state update reaches site j, and the received state', 'and the time deviation between time points t1 and t2 are used to', 'calculate the current position of the shared entity.

GLOBALLY SYNCHRONIZED DR', 'WITH LOCAL LAG', 'From the analysis in Section 3, It can be seen that GR can', 'eliminate after inconsistency, but it cannot effectively tackle', 'before inconsistency. In order to decrease before inconsistency,', 'we propose GL, which combines GR with local lag', 'and can effectively decrease before inconsistency', 'In GL, the state of a shared entity at a certain time point t', 'is notated ast, pos, par 1, par 2, ……, par n), in which pos', 'means the position of the entity and par 1 to par n means the', 'parameters to calculate the position of the entity.

For example, in a', 'graphical user interface a delay of approximately 150 ms cannot', 'be noticed for keyboard interaction and the threshold increases to', '195 ms for mouse interaction , and a delay of up to 50 ms is', 'uncritical for a caacing game . Thus if network transmission', 'delay is less than the specific value of a game system, n can be set', 'to the specific value. Else n can be set in terms of the effects of', 'local lag on the interaction of a system . In the case that a', 'large n must be used, some HCI methods (e.g. echo ) can be', 'used to relieve the negative effects of the large lag. In the case', 'that n is larger than the network transmission delay, GL', 'can eliminate most before inconsistency. Traditional local lag', 'requests that the lag value must be larger than typical network', 'transmission delay, otherwise state repairs would flood the system', 'However GL allows n to be smaller than typical network', 'transmission delay. In this case, the before inconsistency caused', 'by network transmission delay still exists, but it can be decreased', '5.
